Raspberry Pi Case
===

Updated design using case found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:629886).

* Plates were added to protect key components.
* Pillars were drilled through, with long screws inserted to allow Raspberry Pi to be attached to the rear of the horizontal arm structure. With minimal filing, the distance between the pillars is identical to the diameter of the rear hole of the robot arm.
