DualPulley13 has a small pulley radius of 13mm and a bif one of 26mm.
The shaft hole has a radius of 10mm.

Note that the shaft "coupler.stp" may have an external diameter also set to 10mm.
Upon 3D printing, the holes and external diameter maybe slightly different, preventing an easy fit.

The solution is to file/sandpaper, or create a new design.
The joined file coupler_new.FCStd is an unfinished attempt, but the length seems short...
