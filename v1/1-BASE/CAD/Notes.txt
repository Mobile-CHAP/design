Design History:
---------------
The original design of the coupling between the servo motor and the omniwheel had one guide to transfer the torque:
WheelMount.stp
Coupler.stp
We do not have the original CAD files.

There has been an attempt to produce a new design with two guides on the inside shaft to improve the torque transfer capability. 
New-axle-body.FCStd
This is a freeCAD files that can be edited

Another design uses 3 guides on the used shaft for better coupling with the wheel - and less backlash.
New-axle-slider (not on github at present).  


Dimension issues:
-----------------
The file new-axle-body.FCStd has diameters modified for compensating for 3D printing inaccuracies.
Therefore, the outer diameter of the shaft is 9.6mm while the inner diameter of the part fitting in the omniwheel is 10mm. 
These corrections will depend on the quality of the 3D printer used and it is advised to print one set of parts and check if the fit is satisfactory,
i.e. not too tight (so that the parts can be separated if needed) and not too loose (giving too much backlash to the wheel).


Wheel housing
--------------:

this was originally designed on a comercial CAD software and we do not have the original files.
we only have the stl and stp files.
